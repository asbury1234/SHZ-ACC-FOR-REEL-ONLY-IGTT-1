        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: December 11, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By using the Threads Access Token Generator ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The Service is a web-based tool that facilitates the generation of a long-lived Facebook API access token. The Service uses the Facebook OAuth 2.0 protocol to obtain an access token with the permissions you authorize. The generated token is intended for your use in applications that require access to the Facebook or Instagram Graph API.</p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security of Access Token:</strong> The generated access token should be treated as a password. You are responsible for keeping it confidential and secure. Do not share the token with unauthorized individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with Facebook Policies:</strong> Your use of the access token must comply with all applicable Facebook Platform Policies, including their Developer Policies and Terms of Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Lawful Use:</strong> You agree to use the generated access token for lawful purposes only and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of, or restrict or inhibit the use and enjoyment of, the Service by any third party.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no warranty that the Service will meet your requirements, be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. We are not responsible for the security of your Facebook account or the data accessed using the generated token.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall Threads Access Token Generator, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
