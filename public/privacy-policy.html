        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: December 11, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Threads Access Token Generator. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our service.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not directly collect or store any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or other contact information. The authentication process is handled entirely through the Facebook OAuth service.</li>
            <li><strong>Facebook Profile Information:</strong> With your consent, we receive a temporary authorization code from Facebook, which is then exchanged for an access token. The scopes requested may grant us access to certain profile information, pages, and permissions as listed in the authorization dialog. We do not store this information on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect any information automatically when you visit and use the site (e.g., your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The sole purpose of the information accessed through the Facebook API is to generate a long-lived access token on your behalf. This token is displayed to you in your browser for you to copy and use. We do not use your information for any other purpose, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a profile about you.</li>
            <li>Sending you promotional emails.</li>
            <li>Analyzing trends or site usage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your information with any third parties for their promotional purposes. The access token is generated and immediately passed to your client-side browser session. It is never stored on our server.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to revoke the permissions you have granted to this application at any time through your Facebook account settings. Revoking permissions will invalidate the access token and prevent our application from accessing your Facebook data in the future.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
